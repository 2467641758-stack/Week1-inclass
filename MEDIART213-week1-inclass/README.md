- [ ]  “The term [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#paragraph) as defined in this section is used for more than just the definition of the `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` element. The [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#paragraph) concept defined here is used to describe how to interpret documents. The `[p](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/grouping-content.html#the-p-element)` element is merely one of several ways of marking up a [paragraph](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#paragraph).
    
    A paragraph is typically a run of [phrasing content](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/dom.html#phrasing-content-2) that forms a block of text with one or more sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also be used for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a part of a form, a byline, or a stanza in a poem.” From ****[HTML: The Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/)****

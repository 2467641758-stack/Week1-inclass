            <h4>
                I think I'll start with regret. It is precisely those imperfect moments that make up each and every one of us vivid and lively. Regret represents not only the memory point of "still a little short of perfection", but also a kind of tension. The direction of "leaving no regrets" has endowed us with the motivation for many actions. Of course, this kind of "leaving no regrets" doesn't necessarily mean striving to achieve something or creating a wonderful life. It can also be enjoying the present time to the fullest or taking a break to relax and rest to not waste one's energy. In short, it is to achieve some kind of satisfaction.

            <br> <!-- 问题2答案 -->
            <h4>In the past, I was very afraid to face all my imperfections. But now I'm learning to get along with these "imperfections on the circle", and it is precisely these parts that make up the distinct me. I want to keep countless moments when my resume was rejected. Without these moments, it seems that the last little achievement would become even more insignificant. These not-so-smooth moments instead remind me of how difficult and remarkable it is to achieve each small milestone. I want to keep countless red crosses from my middle school days. These deduction points bear witness to my efforts, and how I went from knowing nothing at the beginning to gradually mastering every knowledge point through hard work. I want to keep the experiences of failed relationships. Through these experiences, I gradually learned how to love myself and others, balance altruism and self-interest, and learn to consider others' feelings while also paying attention to myself. If it weren't for all those stories, I wouldn't have been brave and effective in seizing every new opportunity that comes in the future. So, the idea of keeping these is not to celebrate the "narrative of suffering", but to thank myself along the way and all the people and things that have helped me.
